The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"./building.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New And","date":"May 01, 2017","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/2210f48bdd66af7dc924c421048646cf/16310/pexels-photo-1803914.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/new-and/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/hi-folks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings - no image post"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/some-else/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Some Else"}}}}}
